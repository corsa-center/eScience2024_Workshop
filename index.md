# Sustainable Project Pathways for HPC Software

In the realm of High-Performance Computing (HPC), the sustainability of research software is a pivotal concern that intersects with the capabilities and efficiency of supercomputing resources worldwide. But what does "sustainability" entail within the HPC context? How can we measure and enhance the longevity, efficiency, and adaptability of HPC software? What are sustainable project pathways toward self-sustainment within foundations for projects of all sizes? This half-day workshop is dedicated to exploring the concept of sustainability in HPC software projects, diving into metrics and methodologies for assessment and improvement as well as how projects can join foundations over time. The workshop will begin with a discussion on existing metrics that have been defined by groups such as CHAOSS (https://chaoss.community), OpenSSF (https://openssf.org), and others. It will then extend into the discussion on adoption/ development of new metrics and on processes by which new metrics can be developed that address the unique needs of HPC software, including performance optimization, scalability, portability, and the integration of next-generation computing technologies.
